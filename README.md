## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite Applications include:
- Tiktok
- Imessage
- Spotify

Tiktok Features:
- 2x speed on videos
- Profile view history
- Friend exclusive tab

Imessage:
- Gamepigeon and GIFkeyboard (easily linked applications)
- Reactions and reply chains to messages
- Being able to pin contacts/groupchats

Spotify:
- Private and Public playlists
- User specific playlists (daily mix, genre mix, daylist)
- Integration with other applications (discord, imessage, etc)

App Ideas:
I would like to build an app that combines concepts similar to Spotify and Imessage, where users can listen and discuss music in real time. The UI would be a mix of both, where users could join a listening party with a live chat or multiple chats to discuss thoughts on music or podcasts. All users can host their own live chats and choose the music playing, like a DJ almost. Users can pin their favorite users to listen to on the home page, and have a separate page with ready made playlists to play in the listening party app.

## Notes

There were some difficulties with finding the story board file and adjusting editor options, but everything was relatively simpler after watching a few UI tutorials.
